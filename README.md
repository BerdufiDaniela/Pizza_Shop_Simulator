# Pizza_Shop_Simulator 

# Full Description 
The Pizza Shop Simulator replicates the process of ordering, preparing, and delivering pizza in a modern pizzeria. The system uses multithreading and synchronization via mutexes and condition variables to manage customer orders, store resources (chefs, ovens, packers, delivery drivers), and ensure efficient customer service.

The simulation includes:

* Generation of random customer orders with various characteristics.

* Management of the preparation, baking, packaging, and delivery process.

* Recording of statistics such as revenue, successful and failed orders, and service times.

* Utilization of multiple threads to simulate the simultaneous work of several employees (chefs, packers, delivery drivers).

This simulator provides a realistic representation of daily operations in a pizza shop while offering practical experience in the application of synchronization and multithreading in operating systems.
